## 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

### 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a modern **Data Warehouse** and **Analytics solution** using SQL Server.
It follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to showcase data ingestion, transformation, and modeling for analytical insights.

> 🧩 *This project was developed based on the free course “SQL Data Warehouse Project” by .[Data with Baraa] (https://github.com/DataWithBaraa/sql-data-warehouse-project?tab=readme-ov-file).
> The original materials were used for educational purposes and adapted for portfolio presentation.*

### 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project implements the **Medallion Architecture**, structured as follows:

* **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion from source CSV files (ERP and CRM systems).
* **Silver Layer:** Data cleaning, standardization, and integration for unified datasets.
* **Gold Layer:** Business-ready analytical model (Star Schema) optimized for reporting and insights.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Database:** SQL Server / SQL Server Express
* **Tools:** SSMS, Draw.io, Notion, Git
* **Languages:** T-SQL (DDL, DML, and ETL scripts)
* **Architecture:** Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
